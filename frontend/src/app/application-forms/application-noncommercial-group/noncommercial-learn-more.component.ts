        and will be evaluated by the Forest Service within 48 hours of receipt. Otherwise,
        they are deemed granted. All permit applications will be evaluated using the same criteria,
        regardless of the content of the event or gathering.</p>

        <p>A permit can be denied only if it does not meet the evaluation criteria,
        primarily if it violates public safety or public health laws or regulations.
        If the permit is denied, an officer is required to explain the reasons to the applicant in writing.</p>
