Map Description


The Elk Creek Cutting Area is located between the towns of Fraser and Winter Park, which are along Interstate Highway 40. 


The entrance to the Elk Creek Cutting Area is located on County Road 72, which is also Elk Creek Road. The cutting area is approximately 2 miles southwest of the intersection of Interstate 40 and County Road 72. A Safeway and a Murdocks are close to the intersection of Interstate 40 and County Road 72. A tubing hill is located on County Road 72 about a half mile south of Interstate Highway 40.


There is a stop sign at the entrance to the Elk Creek Cutting area at the Elk Meadows Trailhead. The road through the cutting area allows only one-way vehicle traffic and is approximately 6 miles long. There are 9 parking areas: the entrance, the exit and areas named North Pole, Prancer, Evergreen, Frosty, Vista, Elk, and Holly.


There is a stop sign at the exit at the Twin Bridges Trailhead (no parking allowed). Take a photo with Smokey Bear on weekends only with variable hours a short distance before the exit. The road after the exit is Vasquez Road, and Vasquez allows traffic in two directions. Vasquez Road turns into County Road 7, and the Winter Park Town Hall is to the north of County Road 7, just before the road intersects with Interstate Highway 40. There is a stoplight at the intersection of County Road 7 and Interstate Highway 40. The Winter Park Chamber of Commerce is north of the intersection of Interstate Highway 40 and County Road 7.


If you travel north on Interstate Highway 40, you will reach the town of Granby. If you travel south, you can reach I-70.


Travel west on County Road 73, which is also St. Louis Creek Road, to reach the Fraser Experimental Forest. County Road 73 intersects with Interstate Highway 40.
