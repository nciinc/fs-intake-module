Map Description


Understanding Forest Roads


Most paved forest roads have two digits: 46, 63, 57 etc.
Most gravel roads have four or more digits: 4660, 6350, 5730 etc.
You can gauge where a four-digit road may be on the district, by looking at the first two numbers: 
road 4660, connects to the 46 road
road 6350 connects to the 63 road
road 5730 connects to the 57 road
