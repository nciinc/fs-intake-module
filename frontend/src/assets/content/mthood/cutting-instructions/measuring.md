At the {{forestName}}, we have limitations on the size of the tree you can cut. See below
to help you measure and choose a tree that meets your permit's restrictions.

![Height of the stump from the ground](/assets/img/site-wide/tree-stump-height-icon.svg "stump height")  **Stump height:** {{stumpHeight}} inches maximum

![Height of the tree from the ground](/assets/img/site-wide/tree-height-icon.svg "tree height")  **Tree height:** {{treeHeight}} feet maximum

![No cutting tops of trees off](/assets/img/site-wide/tree-top-icon.svg "no tree-topping")  **Take the whole tree.**  Cutting the tree top off is prohibited.

If snow is on the ground, remove it from around the stump so you can accurately measure the stump and tree height.
