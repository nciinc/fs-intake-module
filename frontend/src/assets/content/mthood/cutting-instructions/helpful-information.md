* Tools you might want to consider bringing with you include a handsaw to cut your tree; gloves to protect your hands; a tarp to sit on and/or to move your tree once its cut; and rope or straps to secure your tree to your vehicle.
* Be sure another tree has space to grow within 8 feet of the one you plan to cut. Choosing a tree from an overcrowded area will give the remaining trees more space to grow.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall and ensure all members of your party (and your vehicle) are out of the path of the falling tree.
* Cut the leftover branches from the stump and scatter them.
* Avoid trees marked with paint or designated as a wildlife tree.
* Cut your tree a bit longer than you'll need (6-12"), so you'll have room to make a fresh cut on the bottom before putting it in water.
