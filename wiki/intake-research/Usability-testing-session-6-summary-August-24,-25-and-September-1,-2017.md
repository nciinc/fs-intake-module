# Results and insights

## Application list screen
Some users noticed that for the temporary Outfitter permit applications, that the organization name might be more important than the applicant name. 
Some users were also confused that the organization would show up under the event title column.
Most users called out that the “permit holder” column title didn’t make sense, since they weren’t actually a permit holder yet. “applicant” was suggested as a better title by all users that had a concern with this.

#### Recommendations:
* Change “Permit Holder” column name to “Applicant”

Overall, the column titles required for each application type do not match. Noncommercial applications may have an event title, which Temp Outfitter applications do not. Temp Outfitter applications may have an organization associated with it while most non commercial application won’t.

#### Recommendations:
* If submitted, add the organization name along with applicant name under the “Applicant” column.
Leave “Event Name” column empty for Temp Outfitter applications.

Some users thought it would be helpful to sort applications by type.

#### Recommendations:
* Continue to sort list by oldest date first. Allow users to click the “Type” column title to sort the list by type. Within each grouping of application types, sort but oldest application first.

All users thought the red submit date was useful for identifying non commercial applications that were not reviewed within 48 hours but noted that Temp Outfitter application were not required to be reviewed within a particular time period.
All users thought the red start date was helpful to identify events that were two weeks or less away. 
All users also thought that two weeks was an effective amount of time to start the alert.

#### Recommendations:
* Still sort applications by oldest Submit date first but only display submit dates in red for Noncommercial application submit dates.
