# Results and insights
## Landing page with guides/outfitters
#### Results: somewhat successful
* All users went straight to Temp Outfitter box to find info related to a temp outfitter permit.
* Several users had difficulty finding the learn more link, longer than ideal delay or didn’t find it.
* All users went straight to the non commercial box to find info related to a noncommercial permit.
* Several users had difficulty finding the cost information in the noncommercial box.
* After finding and reviewing the learn more link and asked questions about noncommercial permits, most users expected there to be a learn more link for the non commercial permit box as well.

#### Recommendations:
* Info in each permit box should be bullet list of basic info and requirements.
* Drop learn more onto it’s own line with blank line above, make it a text link  or button that just says, “Learn More”.
* Create learn more page for both permit types to make a consistent experience and resources.


## Learn More Page with guides/outfitters
#### Results: somewhat successful
* Some users felt that the info on the learn more page could be written in a more user friendly and less forest service like language.
* Most users felt that the page was too long and hard to navigate.
* Most users felt that the sections were not always clear or easily understood.
* Some users suggested a section for requirements.
* Most users scrolled through the page scanning for the info they were looking for and were able to find it eventually.
* Several users suggested a menu at the top with anchor links to different sections so you knew right away what topics were covered and could quickly navigate to them instead of scrolling.
* Some users suggested adding restricted area of the forest on the “learn more” page is available so they could find out before applying if an area they wanted to use was unavailable.

#### Recommendations:
* Review learn more info for user focused language and sections
    * Some examples:
         * Rename “A temporary use permit is”. Maybe just “about temporary use permits”.
         * Rewrite the intro with less forest service speak language.
         * Add a “requirements” section.
* Add an anchor link navigation to learn more pages.
* Add restricted areas if available.

## Confirmation page with guides/outfitters and special use admin
#### Results: somewhat successful
* All users felt the info was informative and would help set expectation for next steps.
* All users felt that the SUA contact info was helpful.
* Most users noted that the permits were not delivered via US mail.
* Some guide/outfitter users wondered if there could be timelines included for each step.

#### Recommendations:
* Check on accuracy of info on confirmation page. US Mail, 48 hours etc.

## Application detail page and accept to SUDS flow with special use admin
#### Results: mostly successful
* Most users had trouble realizing that the e-permit system was going to enter all the application data into SUDS.
* Most users felt that the “success” alert message made it clear that the data did get entered into SUDS.
* Some users felt that they may want to go to SUDS to continue processing an application after accepting it. 

#### Recommendations:
* Consider changing the CTA “Accept enter into SUDS” to “Accept and send to SUDS”. “Enter” may be taken to mean, “manually enter” where “send” implies “automatically send”.
* Add link to SUDS on Application list page.
