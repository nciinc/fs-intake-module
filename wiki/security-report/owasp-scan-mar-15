On March 15th, an OWASP ZAP scan was run against a local development environment to identify any security vunerabilities. Upon completion of the scan, three alerts were found:

X-Frame-Options Header Not Set
Risk: Medium

Web Browser XSS Protection Not Enabled
Risk: Low

X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
Risk: Low

After finding these results, the production site was checked to ensure that these alerts were not present. It was found that each of the headers mentioned above are set properly to prevent the alerts raised in the scan.
