## Participants
* Eight SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) who were familiar with the Christmas tree permit application and were recruited from the four pilot forests.  
* All eight SMEs have either attended a sprint review meeting or a previous content review.


##  What information do the SMEs think is missing from the website?
It varies by forest. The following items were found to be missing or incorrect from the specified forest's page content.

* **Arapaho - Roosevelt National Forests**
  * Directions on how to get to the forest from nearby major cities.  
  * Roads will be plowed within the Canyon Lakes District.
  * Bring extra food and water (How to plan your trip)
  * There are no prohibited species of trees.  
  * There is no tree height restrictions.

All four SMEs from Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests also wanted the the city of Granby listed in the forest selection dropdown since it is closer than the currently listed "Fort Collins'. One SME said,

_"So if you click on the dropdown box...are we going to have Granby listed there?" [referring to the city listed in the Arapaho-Roosevelt option] because I think that people might not know to click on Arapaho-Roosevelt...because it says Fort Collins and we're located some place not close to Fort Collins."_

And two SMEs stated they expected to see instructions on how to get to the forest from major cities.

_"I am assuming we would put directions on how to get there." [referring to the forest]_

* **Flathead National Forest**
  * Snowmobiles are currently allowed within the forest and should not be included in the types of motorized vehicles that are prohibited. 
  * The use of chainsaws is permitted.
  *  People are prohibited from cutting only Pacific Yew and Cedar trees; all other tree species can be harvested.   
  * Cutting is allowed anywhere in the forest except for where the rules state.

* **Shoshone National Forest**  
  * Cutting is allowed anywhere in the forest except for where the rules state.
  * There are no restrictions on where you can cut your tree. 
  * There are no restrictions on cutting times.
  * Blue Spruce should be removed within tree species list.

* **Mt. Hood National Forest**
  * Bull Run is not included in list of restricted cutting areas.   
  * No listing of restricted cutting within LSRs (Late Successional Reserves).



## Do the SMEs find the reporting component valuable?
Absolutely! Six SMEs stated they would use the date range reporting to help with manual input of Christmas tree permits into the TIMM system. The other two SMEs don't work directly with the TIMM system and said they would most likely not use the date range reporting for anything other than curiosity on how many permits were actual sold within a given date range.

Half of the SMEs thought the permit ID reporting would be useful for LEOs (Law Enforcement Officers) when looking to validate a permit in the field. The other half found the reporting component of little value and would most likely not use its functionality.

* _"Oh yes...Absolutely. That would totally help us out." [referring to the date range reporting]_
* _"Oh yeah..I like that!" [viewing the date range reporting]_
* _"I think it would be useful for say law enforcement or FPO that was out in the forest and came across someone they wanted to check. [referring to the permit ID reporting]"_




## What do the SME's think of the season and district dates and times update functionality? 
They really like it. Although the only four SMEs from the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests said they would use the district time and date functionality, the other SMEs said they could see its value for forests that had different times and dates within their districts. All of the SMEs thought the ability to change the season dates was extremely useful and would definitely use it. Three of them said they couldn't wait to use the season date update functionality because of the frequent calls of the public wanting to know when they were going to start selling permits.  


* _"I always have front-liners that ask when we can start selling Christmas tree permits, and now I could tell them...check the website."_
* _"Yes, that would be really nice!" [viewing the district dates and times update page]_
* _"Yes. We are trying to keep it so it's the same dates from year to year...because the public is always confused  about when it starts..so you never know what is going to happen...so yes it think it would be useful to have the ability to change it."_
* _"Yes, yes it would be useful. We can tell people to check the website for when we are going to start selling permits."_




## What do SMEs think of the permit design?
They love it! All of the SMEs thought the new permit design looked official and liked the forest tree cutting requirement boxes. All SMEs had no issues identifying the number of trees purchased, but two SMEs had confusion with filling in the tree cutting dates.
The tree cutting date fill in instructions were sometimes overlooked most likely due to their position under the fill in boxes on the permit. One SME suggested moving the cutting instructions on top of the boxes to give more focus. All SMEs were able to quickly identify where the placement location of the permit in order for it to be valid. Two SMEs suggested that the rules or permit include a 6-inch ruler on the edge to allow people a visual reference on estimating tree diameter and stump height.

* _"I love it! I love the fact you put a big 'ole Forest Service logo on it."_
* _"It would be nice to have the ruler, like the one printed on the brochures we hand out. That way you could gauge how big 6 inches really is. I don't see people using it while actually cutting their tree, but it would be a good reference they could use."_ 
* _"I think it looks good other than the rules not being printed along with it [reviewing the purchase permti email confirmation page]."_
* _"I think people would easily be able to figure this out." [reviewing the permit design]_



## Would SMEs like to see a special events section on the website?
No. Not right now anyway.  Half of the SMEs thought a special events section was not needed on the website at this time. Two SMEs from the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests were in favor of the special events section and would definitely use it to post related activities during the Christmas tree season. Three SMEs said posting special events wasn't a priority currently, but could see it being used later on if the pilot application is successful.

* _"I think that's going to be based on what happens in the future if we do continue 'Visit with Smokey'...for right now, I want to hold off on that for now. Well just wait and see...that may change or may not, since that's a big hit...we will just have to wait and see."_
* _"Possibly in the future, but let's see how the launch does first. The biggest question is going to be if people are reading the information on the pagesâ€¦or just clicking the buy button."_




## What other problems or concerns do SMEs have with the website?
Contradicting results from early sprint testing sessions, 3 SMEs did not think the permit required more than one fill in cutting date box. The SMEs did not think permit purchasers would return on different dates to cut multiple trees purchased.
 
* _"Interesting...I did not know that. I would be very surprised to hear that people double up."_
* _"Have you asked Lenora about that? I have not heard anyone mention that before. Not to say that it doesn't happen, but most people bring a truck and fill up the back of it with trees."_

## What do SMEs think about the website overall?
After reviewing the website, the feedback received from the SMEs was generally positive. Four SMEs mentioned they liked the graphics that were added to the 'How to cut your tree' section. Several SMEs were excited about the launch and were eager for the website to be available to the public. One SME remarked on the navigation and how easy it was to find information.

* _"It looks really great!"_  
* _"I like the layout a lot...it makes sense..it's easy to navigate"_  
* _"I really like the symbols, or pictures of the tree cutting."_  
* _"I think it looks good. Really good."_  



## Issues on the site in general

Two notable issues appeared during usability testing and should be addressed.

* NA use on permit
* Christmas tree tag numbers for TIM system

One issue that became apparent and that was the use of 'NA' in areas of the permit that were non-applicable or had no value. Two SMEs did not understand why the 'NA' was used on the permit at first glance, however, after reviewing the permit in more detail accepted its use. 

_"What exactly is the 'NA'?" [when viewing the permit]_


Another issue that came up frequently, although out of scope for this project, was how the date range reporting information would be used as input for the manual permits into TIM. Most SMEs explained that the current manual input process into TIM requires a unique tag number for each tree sold. Because the proposed permit system supplies a single unique permit ID for up to 5 trees purchased, this caused confusion on how exactly this would work with the TIM system.

_"One of the things that I am concerned about is the number of trees on the permit. When we sell them, and I guess I might be getting hung up on some technicalities that aren't that important, but we have one permit per tree and a max of 5 permits you can purchase. I don't know if it is better to do it as like one person was purchasing one permit with 5 trees or if there should be one permit for one tree."_  

_"So I just thought of something, looking at the previous report that you had....and this is why I think we might have to have a seperate permit number per tree, because thats how we have to enter it into TIM. I can't enter a permit number...like 00000011 and tell it that its 2 trees. I have to have a separate permit number per tree."_

_"Yeah, technically when we are selling them on the ground, it is one permit per tree."_


# What problems were most severe

##  Household limits on tree purchases

Three SMEs reviewed the content and had issues with the five tree limit per household. They stated their forest currently had no limitation on the amount of trees that could be purchased by an individual and often had people buying more than five trees when visiting during the Christmas tree season. 

_"In areas that cut Christmas trees...it says only allow to cut up to 5 trees per permit....and on the ground we really don't have any limitations.... I know internally I told Mary and she's been telling folks the same thing..because we get people that come in 8 trees..10 trees and it's ok. I don't know how to address this on the website."_

_"Yeah, normally people usually get up to about 10..at one time."_

## Prohibited tree species 

Four SMEs said there was little to no limitations on prohibited tree species that could be cut in their forest. The SMEs often found the labeling on tree species as incorrect - for example, a species labeled as prohibited, when it wasn't. They also found species that didn't grow in their forest.

* _"No [when asked if the forest had any prohibited tree species]...because what we do have primarly is Lodgepole Pine...and some I think it's Limber Pine and I think Englemann Spruce. There's not a lot of Douglas Fir out there. There may be some Subalpine Fir...but that differs depending on where you are."_  
* _"We don't have any regulations on what species you can cut."_  
* _"They can't cut Cedar or Pacific Yew trees. Other than those, it's wide open."_
