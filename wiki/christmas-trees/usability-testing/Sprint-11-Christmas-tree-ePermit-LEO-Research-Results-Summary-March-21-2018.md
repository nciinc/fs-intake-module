## Participants
* 4 LEOs (Law Enforcement Officers/Forest Patrol Officers) who were familiar with the Christmas tree permit application and recruited from the four pilot forests. One of the four LEOs was unfamiliar with the project and was recruited from outside the pilot forests.


## What information do LEOs think is missing from the website?
Maps. Forest and Christmas tree cutting area maps. All four LEOs were concerned about the limited forest and Christmas tree cutting area maps on the website. They explained that without a map, permit purchasers may not know exactly where tree cutting is permitted or prohibited. Maps also help define areas that may have been recently created or moved based on forest thinning projects.
* _"Now is there a place to print out a map?"_
* _"Maps are really key. If you don't tell people where they can and cannot cut trees, they will go to the first available place and chop 'em down."_
* _"I don't see a map on here where they can cut trees. Is there link here somewhere?" [viewing the Shoshone National Forest page]_






## What do the LEOs think about the permit?
Overall, the LEOs really like it. All LEOs thought the permit design looked official and easily identified it as a Forest Service Christmas tree permit.
* _"I think it looks great!" [while viewing the permit for the first time]_  
* _"With the Forest Service shield on there..it definitely looks official."_  
* _"Yeah, if I pull over and see a car on the side of the road and this is on their dash...it totally looks legit...I would totally know." [referring to a legitimate and official copy of the permit]_  
* _"Yep. It would be great. [referring to the use of the online permit design] It would be left in the vehicle and we would know that's what they're out there doingâ€¦.cutting a Christmas tree."_  

Three LEOs said it would be more difficult to view a black and white Christmas tree tag on the dashboard of a moving vehicle.
* _"I don't know if we could spot or determine if the permit is valid on the dashboard as someone is passing by...in a moving vehicle. We would most likely only verify if it's valid once we pulled them over at the entrance when they leave the forest."_
* _"We [LEOs] are used to looking in the rear-view mirror as someone drives by with a tree to look for the orange tag. This is going to be an adjustment."_
* _"Currently the Christmas tree tags are affixed to the tree in a visible location. Mostly on the trunk of the tree. There is no missing the bright orange tag, which is what we look for when they drive by. Changing to this permit on the dashboard, will be more difficult to spot."_
* _"'It's black and white...and I guess its easier to see a bright orange tag like our firewood tags..so when you're driving down the highway, they catch your eye. Yeah. It's easy to see those tags. [referring to the existing tags]"



Two LEOs were confused about where the permit was supposed to be when someone was cutting down a tree. Although the permit states you must have the permit with you at time of tree cutting and that it must be placed on the dashboard, it doesn't specify where exactly it should be when cutting the tree.    
* _"It just isn't clear where it's supposed to be possessed. When deer hunting and you harvest deer, you have to have it with you, because it says "you must have your license with you"....you see what I am getting at?"_
* _"The people that have cut trees for the whole lives, they're going to want to know where to put this on their Christmas tree. Does that mean when you are cutting your tree? transporting your tree?"_
* _"It just doesn't say if you have to have it out when cutting your tree. You know one instruction may be what are the rules where the possession of this permit would be. It can stay in the truck, you have to have it on you."_

One LEO liked that the permit had an acknowledgement that permit purchasers had reviewed the forest and Christmas tree cutting rules before receiving their permit.
* _"That box that's checked, that's when they are buying it on the computer that's something they have to physically check with their computer or their mouse or something? That's good...because that's what gives us the teeth as law enforcement that says they have read and agreed to that."_







## Do the LEOs find the instructions on the permit easy to understand?
Yes, they do. With the exception of the tree cutting date fill in instructions, all LEOs found he permit easy to understand. One LEO really liked the pattern where the forest specific data was located on the bottom left and the permit rules on the bottom right. All LEOs thought the boxes under the permit forest name to be clearly visible and easy to comprehend.  
* _"Now I really like that...the stump diameter and height is right there. That's great!"_
* _"This permit covers all the bases. Whether it's a one tree limit or a five tree limit."_

Two LEOs were concerned about the placement of instructions on how the purchaser was to fill in the harvest date(s). One LEO completely overlooked the instructions and became confused thinking the dates would be filled in automatically by the system at time of the permit generation.
* _"Maybe move the month and day fill in instructions on top of the boxes. I completely overlooked it...it just blended in." [referring to the fill in instruction current placement]_
* _"I think maybe a 'Tree 1' in the top month and day box fill ins would help. It was clear to me what they were for, but most people probably won't get that."_







## What types of problems do LEOs encounter during the holiday season?
Not many. The  most common issue that LEOs run into with tree cutters in the forest has to do with permit validation. Tree cutters sometimes will not validate their permits, which requires manual changes to the tree tags, unless they are pulled over or approached by an LEO while transporting their trees. Another common issue is tree cutters who say they have lost or forgotten their permits. Unlike other special use permits, when Christmas tree permits are sold, there is minimal information taken from the buyer at time of purchase. This information includes the permit number and sometimes only the buyer name. Without an actual permit number, the LEOs are unable to validate that a permit was purchased.
* _"When we are talking about Christmas trees...it's not a commodity we often see people trying to profit from..like firewood. So with Christmas trees, it's normally just people who forget to get a permit. Nine times out of 10...it's just locals trying to get a Christmas tree...so I just tell them they need to get a permit."_
* _"With a load tag, such as a Christmas tree, if you don't validate it when they are leaving the forest..if they don't get stopped and get it validated, they can go back and reuse it. And then when you finally pull them over, they say 'oh, I forgot to validate it...Let me do that right now for you.'"_
* _Most of the time, we don't have any information other than a persons name and license plate. If they say they forgot or lost their permit, it would be really difficult to see if they actually bought one."_

One LEO mentioned that problems have occurred with commercial vendors who cut more trees than they have purchased or that cut trees for resale.
* _"Sometimes we run into issues with the commercial vendors cutting trees for resale. We don't allow the trees to be commercially resold."_







## Do LEOs find the reporting to be useful?
Overall, the LEOs were split on how useful the permit reporting is. Two LEOs thought the reporting by permit ID would be useful in the field for permit validation if they were able to obtain a permit ID. Although cell service is spotty in the forests, the LEOs might have the capability to create a report if needed on main roads. The LEOs also stated, as an alternative, they could also use their forest service radios to call into the office where an admin could create a report to validate the permit. The other two LEOs would not use the permit ID reporting because they found it to be of no value.
* _"I only would use to verify that a permit is legal." [when reviewing the reporting options]_
* _"Well the only thing we have is the permit number and the only thing we could verify if there is a number on the permit...we could verify when they bought it."_

Two LEOs thought the reporting by date range would be useful in creating a printable report.
* _"When you export out to excel, is that something I can print out?"_
* _"If they didn't have a permit, I could...Yeah it would help, I could easily generate a report and, this is what I do with wood products, I'll carry a report with me so when someone says they left the permit on the kitchen counter...which is what we get a lot of...I could just ask 'When did you buy it?' If they can give me a date, at least I and look it up and see if any permits where sold that day..or if they did have the permit on them...I could just look at the number and match it up with the report and say 'Oh yeah..you bought one a week ago.'"_

One LEO thought the reporting functionality would not be useful for an LEO but could see it being useful with other special forest products.
* _You know the timber people would be more interested in how many permits you know how many trees are coming off the forest...things like that. My job is just to make sure they are legal."_







# What problems were most severe
## Permit re-use or duplication
Most of the LEOs were concerned about how to keep the public from reusing or duplicating a single permit. The LEOs thought the permits could be easily copied and could foresee difficulty validating them in the field unless a unique permit ID was obtained.
* _"How will we be able to control re-printing, copying...etc."_
* _"Is the permit going to be done in black and white?"_
* _"How would we keep people from reprinting the permit over and over again?"_
* _"I don't know if the timber folks have chimed in on this, but you get your tree home and you either let your neighbor reuse this or photocopy it or what have you. It's definitely a concern of mine."
* _"The only problem I see with this, is that if you have someone who is dishonest...they could copy these and use them. Although, people are going to behave badly no matter what."_
