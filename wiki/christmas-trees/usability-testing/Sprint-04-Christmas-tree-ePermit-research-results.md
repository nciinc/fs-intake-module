# Hypotheses tested
* How do people find the closest National Forests to them when they do not know the official forest name? (see below)
* Do people understand the “rules to know” content? (see below)
* How do people interact with the purchase permit form? (see below)
* How do people expect to receive their permit(s)? (see below)
* Are people finding important information, such as dates and times of the cutting season, where they expect to find it on the page? YES!
* Do people want to see more graphics within the content? YES!

## Participants
* Four people were unfamiliar with the Christmas tree permit application and were recruited from friends and family of the project.
* One person works regularly with the Forest Service as part of her job as a biologist and is familiar with their current permitting process.
* One person was familiar with the Christmas tree permit application and has participated in a previous usability test.

## How do people find the National Forests closest to them when they do not know the official forest name?
Five people typed the name of their closest town or city in the search bar if they could not recall the name of a National Forest. One person selected a forest based on the maps on the page. If the search by city was unsuccessful, people would then attempt to type the name of the forest they thought they knew into the search bar.

Three users mentioned that they expected to see a map similar to what Google maps has to offer.

* _"I would use the map if I didn't know where I was going."_

## Do people understand the “rules to know” content?
For the most part, yes. People suggested improvements to the order of the content in this section and to the wording of particular bullet points. One person suggested combining bullet points within the rules to know section into larger groupings or placing similar items closer to each other. Another person noted the rules are scattered throughout the guidelines and that they should be grouped into the one section.
Five people were confused by the first bullet point, which references ‘plantations’ and ‘stands of trees.’ One person who was familiar with this terminology worked with the Forest Service regularly, but said most people buying permits would not understand the language.
* _“All the rules are clear, but the first one is a little questionable."_
* _"I think that would be very hard to know what that means when you are out in the field. I don't know if I could tell exactly what those are" when reviewing the first bullet point."_
* _"I have no clue" [when a person was asked if they understood the first bullet point] plantations and stands of trees."_
* _"Does it mean places where trees are freshly planted? or where trees have been cut down already?"_
* _"That's interesting. You bump around with the rules. They are not all within one single location. I would want them all in the same place.”_

## How do people interact with the purchase permit form?
People were asked to attempt to buy permits to cut down two trees. Four people were able to fill out the fields in the permit form with no issue. The language ‘one tree equals one permit’ confused one person, who attempted to fill out the form twice. This person thought they only received one permit each time they filled out the form; as a result, they believed they had to fill out the entire form twice to purchase two permits for two trees.
Five users were able to identify the limit on the number of trees they were allowed to cut down. All people recognized that they would redirected to Pay.gov and wanted to see a summary of their permit purchase and information before completing their transaction. Two users referenced Amazon’s checkout process as an example of what they were expecting.
* _"It should be simple. The easier, the better."_
* _"I would expect it to be something like Amazon's checkout. You know, where the summary shows."_
* The form was unavailable for one person during their session.

## How do people expect to receive their permit(s)?
Five people expected to be able to print the permit once their transaction was complete. Four people also wanted the permit to be made available in digital form so they could save it on their mobile device and use it during their trip, regardless of their access to the wireless network.
Four people did not know that they would receive their permit via email once their transaction was complete. People missed the language on the form that informed them of this process. One person suggested moving the email language to the top of the form.
* _"That information is really important! You may need to make it a little more clear that you must enter an email address so that it can be sent to you."_
* _"I'd imagine it gets sent in some sort of email., or you could print it out after purchasing right?" [after being asked about how the person would receive their permit]_

## Are people finding important information, such as dates and times of the cutting season, where they expect to find it on the page?
Yes they are! Similar to other usability studies, the six people in this study identified the cutting season’s dates and times, cutting locations, and hours of operation as information they wanted to know as soon as they visited the website.  All people found the information where they expected to see it. One piece of information five users identified as missing was how to buy their permit.
One person was confused by the term ‘daylight hours’ and wanted to know the specific hours of operation. Another person understood the term ‘daylight hours’ but questioned if the forest was open at that time.
* _"If I can't see to get around, I shouldn't be cutting a tree!"_
* _"And that's where it is..so that makes sense." [referring to the dates, times and hours of operation]_

## Do people want to see more graphics within the content?
YES! Just like the previous usability tests, people consistently commented through the sessions that they would like to see more graphics on the pages. Some thought it would be especially beneficial when placing emphasis on key points and information that had a "need to know."

Six people wanted to see the full picture of a tree as well as the branch and needles when reviewing content in the How to Choose Your Tree section. They believed this would help them identify the proper tree.

* _"Maybe add some really easy graphics, nothing fancy, like what is displayed here to show where to measure a tree." [when reviewing the "When you cut" section]_
* _"Maybe add line drawings of an axe, rope, etc, things you would need to cut trees."_


## Issues on the site in general
There are several issues that should be addressed.

* Browser back button returns user to "find a forest" page
* Missing summary page on permit purchase form
* Highlight that people will receive their permits via email
* Lack of easy-to-find, simple text-based instructions or graphics for measuring tree diameter and height

One person noted the content on Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests was missing height limitations for cutting trees and wondered why this information was not on the site. This person has previously purchased Christmas tree permits and knew that rangers provided this information at the time of purchase. The site's lack of information about height restrictions caused concern, as this person thought they had overlooked an important rule.

# What problems were most severe

## Common language
* Almost all people did not understand the language "from plantations and previously thinned stands of trees"  under the "rules to know" content.
* The term "daylight hours" for Mt. Hood confused two people.
* The "one tree equals one permit" language was unclear.

## Header
* The log in and create an account links in the header has been causing confusion during some of the testing. Some people assume you will have to log in to see the button and purchase a Christmas tree permit. This was made apparent when one person stated _"So after I log in, is that when I can buy a permit?"_.


## Graphics and visual elements
* Addition of more graphic elements. The lack of graphics within the content seems to be a recurring issue. A majority of people scan for graphic elements first before reading the content, and as a result key information is often overlooked.
