## Participants
* 3 people unfamiliar with the Christmas tree permit application and were recruited from friends and family of the project. All people have either cut their own tree down from a private Christmas tree farm or national forest.

## What website are people familiar with when it comes to maps?
People tend to use Google Maps on their mobile phones when searching for directions or maps. As an alternative when looking for a specific type of map that Google Maps does not offer, people will search the web (via Google) browsing various websites to find them.
* _I just used Google Maps this last weekend to find trailheads leading into the Mt. Hood National Forest. Although I could not find any topographic maps on the Mt. Hood website, I used Google Maps to get the coordinates of the forest. Once I had the coordinates,  I searched Google to try and find them. It was a very time consuming and tedious process that sometimes yielded no results._


## How do people search for forests?
People in general search for a forest by name rather than city or state.
One person, however, did struggle to locate the Mt. Hood forest when using the "find a forest" search. After typing "mt hood" (all lowercase) in to the textbox, the typeahead failed to provide an auto suggestion. After struggling for a few seconds, the person tried again typing "mt. h" (including the period). On the fourth character entry, the typeahead suggested the Mt. Hood forest as an option to select.

## Do people understand the menu labels and the information found underneath them?
Yes. In general, people seemed to like the menu labels and the information found on their pages. One person was confused by the term "harvest" and did not understand what it meant.


## Do people understand which areas of the forest are prohibited from cutting trees?
Well, sort of. People clearly identified the prohibited roads and highways within the content, but when reviewing the maps in detail they become confused. People have problems identifying prohibited and restricted areas due to the low detail of the maps available.
* _The maps on here don't display where you can go, they only show where you can't go._
* _I don't see where highway 216 is [while looking at a map]. If the map had a little more detail, I might be able to read some of the text on here._


## How do people interact with the maps provided on our website?
People almost always used the maps first before attempting to read any of the content. When asked to complete simple tasks (for example, Is highway 216 a restricted tree cutting area?), people scanned the pages for images and maps searching for summarized key points of information. After scanning the images, then the user would start to read the content.

Several people stated they would like to see some sort of printing feature so they could take the map with them in to the forest. (Since cell phone coverage is spotty in the forest, people would like to print a hard copy to take with them)
* _Is there some way to print this map? Or do I have to right click and print?. [While reviewing a map]_
* _I know when I have been to get a permit previously (mushroom gathering permit) they offer maps for $5 each of the forest. Is there a way to purchase the same maps on here and print them out?_

One person did get frustrated when selecting the "view larger map" link of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest. When they clicked the link and the map displayed in a modal dialog, it was the same size as the previous page with no new detail available. The person was confused since there was no change when viewing the map.
* _It would be extremely helpful if you could zoom in/out when viewing the larger maps. I can't seem to read the highways and roads on some of these maps. If I could zoom in, it wouldn't be a problem._
* _You know what would be nice, is if you could find a map by using directions from your location. Say for example, I am in Detroit and travelling south, which forest is closest to me._


## Can people find forest district maps that are unavailable on our site?
Yes they can. Everyone tested immediately found the link to the national forest website to look for further information and maps. One person did not like the link to be placed at the top of the content though.
* _The last thing I want to see is a link  as the first thing when I select a section from the menu on the left. If I make a selection I would expect that information to be visible and then a link to locate more information, not the other way around_


## Do people feel overwhelmed when viewing the page content?
Yes. People often were confused and struggled with finding information contained within the page content.  They thought key or important information was sometimes often overlooked and missed when located within nested bulleted lists.  One person used "control + f" within the browser to find specific keywords.
* _I completely missed that and would have most likely never read it since it was buried in the bullet list. Its just a lot of information to take in. (referring to page content)_


## Do people want to see more graphics within the content?
People consistently commented through the sessions that they would like to see more graphics on the pages. Some thought it would help break up the information and apply more emphasis on items that are key points.
* _This looks like a plain vanilla website that was created in the early 90's. There's a ton of text and very few images._
* _I would add some sort of graphics or visuals to enhance it. [Referring to the page information]_


## Issues on the site in general
There are several issues that should be addressed.

* Lack of an integrated site search.
* Lack of printing capabilities on available district maps.
* Lack of more detailed maps for districts with clearly defined designated tree cutting areas.
* Lack of graphics used throughout the content.


# What problems were most severe

## Forest search
* When entering a name/state/city in the forest search, trigger the typeahead auto suggestions on the 2nd character entry rather than the fourth. For example, Mt. Hood would be suggested after the "mt" is entered eliminating the need to create a work around in code for the identification of special characters (ie, the period)

## Maps
* Provide people with optional highly detailed and printable maps that clearly display restricted and non-restricted cutting areas.

## Navigation
* Remove the word "harvest" from the menu item labels and page content. This has been identified as an issue in previous user study sessions and should be replaced with "cut" to avoid future user confusion.
* _It's not real clear to me that these are links either.[ Referencing the left hand TOC navigational menu]. The links are the same color as other things on the screen..which I find a little confusing._


## Graphics and visual elements
* Addition of more graphic elements. The lack of graphics within the content seems to be a recurring issue. A majority of people scan for graphic elements first before reading the content, and as a result key information is often overlooked.
