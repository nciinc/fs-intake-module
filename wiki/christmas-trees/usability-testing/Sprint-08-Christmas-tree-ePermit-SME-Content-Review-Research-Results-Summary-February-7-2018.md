## Participants
* Five National Forest SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) who were familiar with the Christmas tree permit application and who were recruited from the pilot forests.
* All five SMEs had not previously participated in usability testing.



## Does the reporting functionality provide the Forest Service staff with the information they need and is it useful?
Well sort of. Three SMEs found the ability to search for a permit by permit ID to be useful but only when used in an office environment. They believed it could be helpful
in situations where a LEO (law enforcement officer) calls in looking to validate a permit provided by a person in the field. In early testing, this functionality could not be used in the field by LEOs
due to the lack of cell service coverage in the forest areas.
Four SMEs found the reporting by date range to be not of much value and would most likely not use its functionality. One SME, however, said that reports are occasionally run to validate all permits purchased
within a certain date range. In this scenario, they felt the date range reporting could potentially be helpful. However, without names or license plate information in the report, its value would be limited. Another SME pointed out that vendors buy permits in bulk and wondered how the online reporting functionality would work with bulk purchases.

* _"I think it would be useful for, say, a law enforcement or FPO that was out in the forest and came across someone they wanted to check. [referring to permit validation]"_
* _"I guess with Christmas tree permits I would be looking by permit ID. [after being asked how they would use the reporting functionality]"_
* _"Sometimes I do that as well...you know the timeline of it being bought vs. entered into the system where I could look it up. [referring to validating a permit that was recently sold and not updated in the TIMM system]"_
* _"That doesn't always work...because our vendors sell a lot of permits and we don't put them in TIMM individually. We put them what is called a 'manual' permit so they are lumped under one name. [referencing one potential problem with vendor bulk permit purchases and the online report]"_





## What Christmas tree permit information do Forest Service staff think is missing from the website?
Not much. Three SMEs mentioned maps of the Christmas tree cutting areas, Motor Vehicle Use maps and directions on how to get to the forests. One SME stated that the MVU maps are available on the
current forest website and wondered why they weren't available on the Christmas tree permit website. One SME thought the definition of LSRs (Late Successional Reserves) should be included on the website to educate visitors on possible areas where cutting is prohibited.

* _"Yes...this is the map I was talking about...but what that map doesn't tell you is HOW TO GET THERE. It's a map on when you are there [referring to the cutting areas] but not how to get there....and that's what we kind of need...is a map of how to get there."_
* _"So what we offer them is they can either purchase a forest or district map or we give them a free MVU map which is the black-and-white version to show them the land ownership so that they know they are on forest service land and that they are on an area designated as open. We do have links to the motor vehicle use maps on our external webpage..so they could actually download the .pdfs or use avenza.com and download the .pdfs too."_
* _"How would you explain what an LSR is because it's not marked on the ground...it's kind of like a Wilderness area."_






## Do the Forest Service staff think the dates and times are appropriately associated with the proper cutting areas and/or ranger districts?
When talking with SMEs from the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests...no. Three of the five SMEs were located from districts in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests and were confused about the
dates and times displayed in their forest. One possible solution mentioned by a SME is to combine the when and where information together on the site.

* _"I think it's a good idea to break the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests into two separate districts. I don't know if there is any consistency between the two right now because they do operate differently. Their regulations are quite different."_
* _"I guess, if I lived north of Denver and I wanted to go cut a Christmas tree. You know it's inherently confusing. Like I said that Sulphur and Canyon Lakes both have developed Christmas tree cutting areas...and they have particular hours...and then Sulphur has more of a...you know you can go anywhere in their district. So, I guess if I was trying to figure out when and where to go..I would be confused."_
* _"I'm assuming the season dates are just placeholders right now..."_
* _"Probably are not going to start selling them [referring to Christmas tree permits in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests] in August."_




## Does the Forest Service staff think the rules are accurate for their forest and does the page design draw attention to the importance of the rules?
Mostly no. All five SMEs spotted rules that were either not applicable or incorrect on their forest's pages.

* _"Basically most of them don't match. [referring to the rules on the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests pages]"_
* _"This isn't accurate...you can't cut trees anywhere on the forest land. There are particular spots...located on the maps."_
* _"Is that from another forest? I'm not sure if that's true for our forest. [reviewing the max stump height for Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests]"_
* _"We don't have any regulations on what species you can cut."_



## What other changes would the Forest Service staff like to see on the website?

One SME, while reviewing the rules of their forest, mentioned that current Christmas tree permits available to the public for purchase has a ruler printed on the side of it. This allows permittees to measure and gauge the diameter of trees. Another SME noted that listing all ranger district offices may not be helpful for the public since some of them do not actually sell Christmas tree permits or answer questions about the permits.

* _"These offices don't sell permits and you can't cut Christmas trees on them. It's true they are ranger districts...but they are not going to help anyone looking for Christmas trees. [referring to the Boulder and Clear Creek districts of the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests]"_
* _"It's interesting that you put the districts where you can't get Christmas tree permits or information...so I'm not sure why it's there."_


## Issues on the site in general

# What problems were most severe

## Rules
**Easy-to-understand and accurate language**

All of the SMEs were confused about the language used when listing the rules for each forest. Others noted that certain rules didn't apply to their forest. Also, some rules might be important information to know, but not necessarily a 'rule' for their forest.

* _"The stump must be 6 inches high or less. I'm pretty sure that's a rule that we have. It's a little awkward..it sounds like you're trying to shoot for 6 inches high."_
* _"We allow chainsaws here."_
* _"So we have different colors of paint for different reasons...so I would say just paint in general...might be a better way to word it."_
* _"I thinks it's true...but I wouldn't call it a rule. [referring to the content that states safety is your responsibility]"_
* _"OK, again, that's one that I'm not sure about. That's not a rule we have in the Red Feather Lakes cutting area.[referring to the content that states 100 feet of a trail, 200 feet of a campground or recreation site
campground]"_

**Email attachment of rules with permit**

Several SMEs asked if permit purchasers would receive a copy of the rules when they were emailed their permit.

* _"So the regulations and rules, is that like an attachment when they print this off? Does it come like page one and page two?"_
* _"I think [the website] looks good other than the rules not being printed with the permit."_

**Ordering of rules as they appear on the page**

Three of the five SMEs inquired about the ordering of rules listed on their pages. The SMEs said that certain rules were more important for their particular forest and wanted the more important rules emphasized. Also, new rules can be added (or old rules removed), and they wanted to know how to keep the content up-to-date and to draw attention to any changes.

* _"There are other rules that are much more important..for example..four-wheel drive or traction devices are required."_
