## Participants
* 11 ADMINs (Forest Service Administrators) who were familiar with the Christmas tree permit application and recruited from the four pilot forests. Some ADMINs have participated in previous usability tests.


## What do the ADMINs think about the website?
They LOVE it!  Overall, the ADMINs really like the aesthetics and the navigation. All of the ADMINs I talked with had nothing but positive feedback about the website. Most ADMINs are excited about the launch of the pilot application and mentioned they are eager about using the website. Two ADMINs said they thought application was a great start for a pilot project. Three ADMINs said they were extremely curious to see how well the launch goes and are looking forward to adding more forests in to the application. Four ADMINs thought the use of the graphic icons enhanced the content and really liked the landing page design.
* _"This looks simple. I don't think you will have any problems with people using this."_
* _"Customer service is what we want. I think that's the main thing we are giving them." [while reviewing the website]_
* _"I think this is great!"_
* _"Awesome! this is so exciting!"_
* _"I just love those graphics! That is just perfect. I love the take the whole tree one...it shows you not do that."_
* _"From what I have seen today...I think we have a really great starting point." [referring to the landing page]_








## What information do ADMINs think is missing from the website?
Maps. Maps. Maps. Seven of the eleven ADMINs agreed that the vacancy or display of inaccurate forest and Christmas tree cutting area maps would be an issue for them when viewing the website. The ADMINs were concerned about the possibility of tree cutters harvesting trees from outside forest boundaries without the use of maps. ADMINs with front-line office experience heard tree cutters consistently ask for areas and directions to places where they can harvest trees when purchasing permits. The ADMINs thought it would be a time saver if they could direct people to the website for information and maps on cutting areas and locations. The ADMINs also believe they would receive a high volume of calls regarding cutting areas and locations if the maps were not available on the website.
* _"A lot of people want to know where to go. Including a general map. We get a lot of questions for maps. They want to know where they can go."_
* _"And so one of the things that came to mind...and I think you may have addressed it in the maps..is that we border the Bridge of Tetons National Forest...and so our concern would be that if someone was coming on here, and we are very close. You could come up the south pass here and all of the sudden your either on the LM lands or your on the Bridger-Teton...and so it's going to be important to have that map correct on there so that they [referring to permit purchasers] know their tag is strictly for the Shoshone and they know where they are cutting. Most people that cut around here are local and know their boundaries. But there might be a few people who are not."_
* _"If people come on here and don't see ours [referring to maps] they are going to be calling all over the place."_
* _"Well yeah, it is kind of confusing [referring to non-existing maps]...because we can't explain which places are ok to cut. Most likely they don't know that area and can't decipher that they are on the forest [land] vs. the reservation...they assume it would be marked."_
* _"So maybe like the special products coordinator for the forest could update these [referring to the season dates updates] every year."_

TWO ADMINs thought that food and water should be added within the list of things suggested in the 'How to plan your trip' section. Although an overnight survival kit is mentioned, the ADMINs thought food and water should be called out within the list of suggested items.
* _"This is redundant to me, but maybe not the people from town...but the 'Roads may not be plowed. ..bring an overnight survival kit' bullet...hopefully people would think that includes water and food...but maybe not. Maybe add in food and water." [referring to 'How to plan your trip']_
* _"It seems to be common sense, but you would be surprised how many people forget extra food or water when coming up here. If someone gets stuck, it can take a while to get them out...so I would advise putting that specifically on here."_

Three ADMINs wanted to see information on tree species elevations. They said that in previous sales of Christmas tree permits, it is not uncommon for permit purchasers to inquire about a certain species of tree and where they could find them.   
* _"I think it would good to have elevations because a lot of people come in and go 'I want a Noble Fir'  and the Noble Firs are 1000 feet and above. I don't think they understand accessibility and their hopes are really high."_
* _"The map is the big one...they want to know where to go and what species are out there. A lot of people want Douglas Firs or Noble Firs...etc. Something we have done in the past is included a hand out on where the elevations are on those types of trees. That might be helpful on this site...like including the elevations for the species."_
* _"Noble Firs are the most popular here. And yes they [referring to tree cutters] do have to go to a higher elevation."_

One ADMIN thought it would be helpful to have pictures of pine cones to help tree cutters identify the different species of trees.
* _"One thing that I find might be helpful. On the image of the Noble Fir, for example, to have an image of the cone, because that is so distinctive, so I think that might be helpful in identifying the tree...it would help people that aren't really familiar with them"._

Three ADMINs thought that a list of vendors should be available to visitors on the website. With some forests selling a majority of their Christmas tree permits from vendors, they thought it would be good to provide a list where permit purchasers could go to buy Christmas tree permits in person.
* _"Lets just say someone comes on here and the database is down. Or they get frustrated for some reason or another ...it might be helpful to list the places where they could go to purchase permits in person."_
* _"Yeah, and that would be good..to give them the option to purchase from a vendor. Some people get really nervous buying on the web."_
* _"You know having this [referring to a vendor list] and the online system..it could take a lot of pressure off the districts."_

One ADMIN requested an instructional sheet with information on purchasing a Christmas tree permit online for internal office use. The ADMIN recalled multiple selling experiences where people in previous years had called or come in to the office looking for help on issues dealing with their Christmas tree permits. The ADMIN thought it would be a good idea to have a list of procedures or steps outlined in a document for purchasing a Christmas tree permit online. This document would make it easier for them to help permit purchasers in the event they ran in to an issue while purchasing their permit online.
* _"As collection officers and front liners, If you sent us a sheet that says that's what the process would be...so that if people did call with problems, I could say "I'm sorry, it went through pay.gov and you should have received a page that said that if something happens, this is how to resolve it."_








## What do the ADMINs think of the season dates and district time update functionality?
They think it will make it easier on them. Eight of the ADMINs would definitely use the forest season update functionality within the website. The ADMINs said that a frequently asked question from members of the public is 'When do the Christmas tree permits go on sale?'. They liked having the ability to update the forest season dates since those dates change yearly based on the calendar. They also felt it was useful that they could direct the public to the website for information on the beginning dates for Christmas tree permit sales.
* _"Yes, I think this is very helpful actually...because I know we get quite a few calls here asking when we are going to start selling Christmas trees. That is a question that has been on people's minds. So now they could come on to the website and see 'Oh it looks like I could come and start doing that ...then." so I think it would be helpful to them. [referring to permit purchasers]"_
* _"It won't probably be us doing this..it will be our special forest products person who will do this (Jason Page)...and our start and end dates are not always set..so this would work well I would think."_
* _"Yep. Oh yeah, this is totally a plus, because everybody always want to know, 'When can we start buying Christmas trees?'."_
* _"We do have people that call a lot and ask if they can do this online. [referring to purchasing a permit] So they will definitely be happy about this."_
* _"Oh I definitely think this works. We are a pretty small forest and our process is pretty...it doesn't change very much from year to year, but I think if we get the opportunity to update them at the beginning of the season once a year. It's going to be a big help for us."_
* _"Yep. Oh yeah, because everybody always want to know. When can we start buying Christmas trees?"_

Only the four ADMINs from the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests said they would use the district season dates and times functionality. With Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests being the only forest with different district season dates and times out of the four pilot forests included in the project, it is understandable that they would be the only ones interested in its functionality. All four ADMINs from the forest said they would use the functionality.
* _"For us at the Canyon Lakes District, this works great!"_
* _"No I don't think this would make sense for us. Because we don't vary...we are a smaller forest. And we don't vary our dates...amongst the districts that is."_
* _"We do our times as a forest...there's no variation between districts. [reviewing the Mt. Hood forest page]"_
* _"I can see this being a huge asset for us here. It's really nice being able to change the dates between the different cutting areas and districts. Awesome!"_








## What kind of content updates would ADMINs need to make on the website?
Mostly yearly updates to the forest and season dates and hours of operation. Due to yearly calendar date changes, the need to change season dates and hours of operation would be necessary. In the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests, the districts vary slightly from the cutting areas times and hours of operation. This results in the need to update the districts season dates and times yearly.

Most ADMINs believed that once the content for their forest was set up, they would require very few updates to the content. Two ADMINs thought maps would require updates in the future. This was mostly due to the addition or removal of roads located within the maps. Several ADMINs also mentioned weather conditions and road closures as something that would need to be updated on the website.

* _"Like we just discussed, the different districts and their hours of operation. And any new road closures or closed areas that have to be updated due to fire or anything."_
* _"Maybe new roads could be added to maps...or some taken off...you never know."_
* _"No. We wouldn't really have a need to change anything, except maybe once..to set it up."_
* _"We would mostly want to update weather conditions. things like road closures..etc."_







## How often would ADMINs need to change the content on the website?
Once a year. Other than changing the season dates or district times once a year, most ADMINs did not see the need for any future changes. Some ADMINs believed forest or cutting area maps would need to be updated or changed every few years.  
* _"I would say once a year, prior to the Christmas tree cutting season."_
* _"We would most likely only need to update things once a year. Maybe new roads could be added...or some taken off...you never know." [referring to map updates]_








## Do the reports give the ADMINs the information they need?
For the most part, yes. Eight ADMINs thought the reporting functionality was useful and would use the date range reporting to help them enter manual data in to the TIM system. Using the reports, an ADMIN could verify the amount of Christmas trees that were sold within a certain time frame. Although the ADMINs were not clear on exactly how data would be entered in to the TIM system, they agreed the date range reporting would help aid them in that process.
* _"OK..I see...so this information will be compiled to put into one of our manual permits, just like the other ones...and then the front-liner will input them in...yes. Very helpful!"_
* _"I wouldn't use any of this...no. [reviewing the reporting functionality]  I am only accountable for what I sell. And that isn't very many. I have a ledger, and I know how many I have sold."_
* _"I am very excited about the reporting, I think it will work out perfect for our needs."_
* _"This would probably be very good, you know, because I guess to put it in to TIM, we gotta figure out how many they may have sold right?  So I would assume this what we need to figure out how many they sold in a certain time period...match the numbers, the money..etc. We have to have a way to get it to TIM somehow. Now we have to manually do that."_
* _"It looks like this would be something that would work....definitely."_

Only three ADMINs thought the report by permit ID would be useful, but felt it would be used by an LEO. The ADMINs thought an LEO could use to verify a permit in situations where a permit needed to be validated.
* _"And that might be very helpful where if you run into a situation that's not quite looking right."_
* _"The only reason I could see for using this report is for law enforcement purposes or accountability...or maybe just to see how things are working. [reviewing the report by date range page]"_

One ADMIN thought the reporting should also include the permit purchaser's name. Using the name, an ADMIN could search for a lost permit and reissue one if needed.  
* _"If lets say Mr. Smith comes in to the office and says I lost my permit, then the other helpful point of it might be. Well they don't have a name for them [referring to the reporting information]..just the permit number. But I still wouldn't know the permit number..so maybe a helpful point on this report would be to add the name so we could reissue the tag."_

Three ADMINs did not find any of the reporting functionality useful and said they would most likely not use it. This was most likely due to the fact they are not responsible for any of the Christmas tree tag manual input in to the TIM system. The ADMINs that found the most use out of the reports were mostly the ones assigned to work with the TIM system.
* _"My job...I wouldn't need to run any reports...but it would be fun to see. It might be neat to see what the forest sold...just out of curiosity ..or for bragging rights. lol!"_
* _"Well, I think I would use this...but more from a curiosity standpoint. Really I couldn't do too much with this status. But I would be curious to see especially as we launch for the first 2 years to see how people are using the online permitting. But it would be mostly from curiosity."_
* _"It would just be interesting to see how many were sold, or how many trees families are getting. But otherwise I wouldn't need that report. [referring to the date range report]"_








## What other information or content would ADMINs like to see on the website?
Weather conditions and road closures. Three ADMINs expected to see some type of weather information located somewhere on the website. One ADMIN wasn't sure of who would be assigned the responsibility for weather and road closure maintenance on the website. The ADMIN suggested linking to an external source for automated weather updates.
* _"It would be nice to have a spot for the weather and road closures. I don't know who exactly would keep up with that...or even if it's possible."_
* _"I think we were expecting something about weather and how it is related to where you can actually go to find your tree. I do like what you have here though..it looks good."_
* _"Since the weather changes quickly here, I would think you would have that on here"_







# What problems were most severe

## Unique TIM Christmas tree tag numbers
One ADMIN was concerned about the absence of unique tag numbers for each Christmas tree sold. When purchased online, a Christmas tree permit may be valid for up to five trees with only a single auto generated permit ID for the amount of trees sold. If the permit was been purchased for five trees, four of those trees would be missing a unique tag number, which is required for entry in to the TIM system.

* _"I'm still a little fuzzy on how his will interact with TIM...will we be manually entering this? I guess you would have to....I am trying to picture how that will happen...."_
* _"The way the system works [TIM] for each manual tag we create, we put the tag number for the tree in. So for this permit is for 2 trees, where would the other tag be? I wouldn't be able to enter the same permit ID for 2 different trees...it doesn't work like that."_

In a previous SME content review, a possible solution was offered. In the TIM system, there is a comment input that would allow the total number of permits sold  to be entered. For example, if a manual tag in TIM was created, the total dollar amount for trees sold could be entered and then in the comment input enter the number of Christmas tree permits sold. This allows the total dollar amount to stay correct and the total number of Christmas tree permits sold to be recorded. To get the total number of Christmas trees sold, you would divide the total dollar amount and divide it by the cost per tree, which produces the total trees sold value.
* _"So that's going to be something to consider. When that is done [manual tag input into the TIM system], you can go back to the comments and it will be very easy to put in a comment that says 'Permit numbers 1 through...whatever you've got there.'"_
