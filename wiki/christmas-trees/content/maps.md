#Maps and other images

##Image size and resolution

Map and other images that are provided by the forests to be included in the site 
need to be created at a high enough resolution to be printable by the user. 
1200 x 1600 should be adequate in most cases.

## Image accessibility

Each image needs to be given a text description for the purposes of section 508 accessibility
compliance.  In the case of maps, that description should follow the pattern of the current
map descriptions and be added into config/map-details.json along with a link that includes
'map description' in the alt text, for example:

        [Sulphur Ranger District map description](/christmas-trees/forests/arp/maps/sulphur)  

## Thumbnails

A thumbnail version of the map may need to be created
to speed up page load times when not displaying the full-size map.
