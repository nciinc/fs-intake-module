# Design Approval and Review Process

1. After initial content workflow (content is researched, added to story, approved by Amber and Melissa), create design mockup.
   Note: Design mockups could be done in html/live code on a branch or in any other tool.
2. Attach one or more screenshots of designs (as needed) to the story and uses @symbol address to notify for review.
3. If necessary a small adhoc meeting to demo the mockups should be held.
4. If needed, usability testing is done on the selected mockup.
5. Throughout the sprint, TTS reviews mockups and checks the "Pre approved" task which implies that the story can be deployed to staging.
6. After PR and staging deploy, card is moved into "In Staging" column on Zendhub board.
7. If changes are needed, additional tasks can be added to the story and implemented until product owner gives final approval.
8. During or at the end of sprint review, if there are no changes needed, the PO moves the story to "In Review."
9. The "In Review" column is where a code review and design review should be conducted by TTS.
10. If a story passes code review, it should receive the "18F Code reviewed" label; if the story passes design review, it should receive the "design reviewed" label. 
11. Stories in the "In Review" column that have all three labels (code reviewed, design reviewed, and usability tested*) are moved to "Done" column.

_*The "usability tested" label can be applied once NCI has usability tested the new content/feature/functionality (this usually occurs when a story is "In staging" or "In review")_
