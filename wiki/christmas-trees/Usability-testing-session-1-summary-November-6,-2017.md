# Purpose
To test the initial menu, navigation, tree species page and tree cutting pages.
 
## Test session details
* 5 testers scheduled.
* 5 total testing sessions performed.
* Testers were members of the public who were recruited via email from the project team's friends and family. 
* Each testing session was scheduled for 1 hour and all 5 sessions lasted between 30-45 minutes.
 
## Session overview
Each tester was asked about their first impressions of the website and to  complete several simple tasks relating to locating information within the content. For the simple tasks, users were provided a different scenario and then asked to locate information for the following:
* Tree stump height requirements
* Maximum height rules for a tree to be harvested
* Significance of blue paint on a tree's bark

## General outcome
* Most users were confused about their location on the page when scrolling. This was likely due to the sticky header covering section headings and the menu not selecting the proper item when its anchor was reached in the page. 
* Some users thought key or important information was difficult to find and often overlooked when located within bulleted lists. 
* All users suggested the use of more graphics.


# Results and insights


## Sticky title bar

**Result: unsuccessful**

* Four of the five users failed to identify the name of the National Forest they were currently browsing. This was likely due to the position and font size used in the sticky header. Three of the users eventually identified the name after completing one or two tasks.
* Three of the five users found the dates located in the sticky header to be useful and would prefer them to be visible on all pages.
* Four users agreed that the dates should be visible on the guidelines page if removed from the sticky header.
* Two users became confused about where they were on the page due to the sticky header. The header would cover and hide the heading or title when a user selected a menu item and the page auto-scrolled to its location.

**Recommendations:**

* Remove sticky title bar and replace with breadcrumb navigation.
* Move permit dates on to the guidelines page.
 

## Single page scrolling

**Result: unsuccessful**

* Four users were confused by the menu structure while scrolling down the page. This confusion occurred when a user scrolled down the page (mainly after selecting a menu item). Since the menu does not select the item when the user scrolls to its title within the page, they assume that all the content is located under whatever menu item they are currently on or have selected.

**Recommendations:**

* Change the single scrolling page layout to multiple pages broken by menu item or clearly break the sections by adding space in-between them (and possibly a horizontal line)
 
 
## Page graphics

**Result: mostly successful**

* Three users would prefer more graphics to help break up the content. The users felt that having more images within the content would help make it easier to explore and digest.
*Two users "scanned" the page for graphics and then referenced the bulleted text located adjacent to it. This caused brief hesitations when users were searching for information on a particular task. There were several mentions from both the users that they expected images to line up with their bulleted item. 

**Recommendations:**

* Add more graphics to pages and explore different layouts using those graphics to bring focus to important information.
* When using graphics within bullet points, make sure they line up to their corresponding item adjacently.


## Prohibited or key information

**Result: unsuccessful**

* All users had issues with locating specific key pieces of information.
* Three users commented that key or important information they were tasked with locating was buried within the bullet lists. One user stated “It’s not easy to see in this information, I thought it would be under "How to choose your tree". It’s buried in here, and I completely overlooked it” when tasked with finding the significance of blue painted bark. Another user stated "There is too much information here and the important pieces seem to be buried within the bullet lists." 
* One user expected the tree descriptions to contain warnings and other important information. (for example, designated as a wildlife tree)


**Recommendations:**

* Highlight or move prohibited and key information to the top of the page.


## Menu items

**Result: somewhat successful**

* Two users felt the "Plan your trip" menu item was not needed. They expected information found there to be located under another menu item or items. 
* Two users felt the contents under “Your safety comes first” should be located under “How to harvest your tree”.
*One user was confused about the word "harvest" and thought it might refer to seeding and growing your own tree within the forest.
* Three users mentioned a "Rules and Regulations" menu item that would contain a summary of the important and must know rules of tree cutting in the forest.

**Recommendations:**

* Combine "Plan your trip" with "Where to find your tree" or remove the "Plan your trip' menu item
* Combine "Your safety comes first" with "How to harvest your tree" or remove the "Your safety come first" menu item
