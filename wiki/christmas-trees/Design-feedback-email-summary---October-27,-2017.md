# Purpose
To obtain feedback on possible design pattern considerations for the layout of the Christmas tree permit website.
 
# Test session details
* 10 users emailed.
* 1 user design feedback session performed.
* Feedback gathered on volunteers from an initial email outreach from 18F.
* Each user was asked to respond within a 48 hour time period from receiving the request for feedback email.
* All users were sent an email containing three different design patterns under consideration for the layout of the  Tree Species page within the application.

 
# Session overview
Each user was asked for feedback via email on their initial thoughts and comments around design pattern considerations.  The users were asked for any first impressions of the patterns and which one they preferred. They were also asked to identify the purpose of the page.
 
 
# General outcome
Overall, each user feedback response could be considered successful with only minor issues or confusion.
* Two users were confused on where to purchase a permit and its navigation within the design.
* Three of the five users preferred the 2-column layout structure and design of the first pattern.
* Three users had confusion with the page title.
* All users could identify the page location within the left sidebar TOC navigation in pattern 1.
* One user suggested using a viewer rating system to determine the most popular tree species.
 

# Results and insights
 

# Design Pattern 1
**Result: successful**
* Two users had difficulty locating the name of the selected districts within the header.
* Three users thought the design was simple, clean and easy to use.
* One user had confusion with labeling the Pacific Yew as prohibited. The user thought it made it to appear as though it was prohibited from growing in the forest as opposed to them cutting it down.
* Two users felt the pattern was a little condensed making the content sometimes difficult to read.
* Four users identified the purpose of the page was to educate the viewer on different tree species.
* One user had an issue with the content when using the term "natural".

**Recommendations:**

* Implement the first design pattern as the overall layout for the application.
* Add additional white-space to content to allow improved readability and an improved legibility.
 
# Design Pattern 1 - Grid View
**Result: somewhat successful**
* Two users liked the grid view more than the list view in pattern 1.
* One user suggested a toggle in the content area that would allow the grid view and list view to be displayed on users click
* Two users liked the hyperlink to view more information for each tree species at the bottom of each card
* Two users thought the dark border color and label of "prohibited" for the Pacific Yew was an indication that the item was selected.

**Recommendations:**

* Add a view toggle for grid/list view options allowing the user to select their viewing preference
* Add a "more information" hyperlink to all tree species linking to more photos and detailed information about the species
 
 
# Design Pattern 2

**Result: mostly successful**

* Two of the five users preferred this layout and pattern over the other designs
* Two users liked the amount of white-space and preferred the full page width which had a hard vertical right position of the images
* Three users preferred the header design over the other headers
* Two users were confused about the title of the page and thought it was "Christmas tree permit" rather than "Tree Species"
* All users identified the Pacific Yew as a prohibited tree species.

**Recommendations:**

* Make the page title "Tree Species" and remove the "Christmas tree permit"
* Retain white-space in content design
* Keep labels to identify the prohibited tree species
