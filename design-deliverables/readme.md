## Overview

Deliverables for the development of the online ePermitting project application for the U.S. Forest Service.

The U.S. Forest Service is engaged in an ongoing effort to modernize and simplify their permitting processes. One facet of this effort is to make special use permits available to obtain online. Flexion worked with GSA's Technology Transformation Service's Office of Acquisitions and the Forest Service to build out this platform for noncommercial,  temporary use and Christmas tree permits.

In an effort to maintain design consistency and communicate user interactions between the ePermitting application processes, design deliverables were created to help guide decision making. Those have been listed below.

## Common Components

## Christmas Trees
Deliverables created in development of the Christmas tree permit application process.

### Design Support
Initial assets that were created in order to support decisions made before the development processes. These assets helped communicate and validate design decisions and were tested in [usability testing sessions](https://github.com/nciinc/fs-permit-platform/wiki).
