## Overview

Deliverables for the development of the online ePermitting project application for the U.S. Forest Service

The U.S. Forest Service is engaged in an ongoing effort to modernize and simplify their permitting processes. One facet of this effort is to make special use permits available to obtain online. Flexion worked with GSA's Technology Transformation Service's Office of Acquisitions and the Forest Service to build out this platform for noncommercial,  temporary use and Christmas tree permits.

In an effort to maintain design consistency and communicate user interactions between the ePermitting application processes, design deliverables were created to help guide decision making. All deliverables were created in accordance to the [18F/Forest Website Design Standards](https://nciinc.github.io/fs-fork-uswds-site/).
